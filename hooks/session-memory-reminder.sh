🔴 MANDATORY SESSION START PROTOCOL

BEFORE responding to ANY user request in this project, complete this checklist:

☐ 1. Invoke memory-management skill using Skill tool
☐ 2. Run: pensieve entry search
☐ 3. Show the search output (even if empty)
☐ 4. Acknowledge findings or state "No memories found"

This is NOT optional. This is NOT a suggestion. You MUST complete this protocol.

Why: Past learnings contain solutions to problems you're about to face.
Skipping = wasting time re-discovering solutions.

Evidence before claims - show the actual search output.
